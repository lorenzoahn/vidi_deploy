teach you how to make it in literally 60
0:09

Tutorial
0:21
folding it in half like
0:24
this open the paper up and you can fold
0:27
triangles like this but leave a little
0:29
gap between The Edge and the center
0:31
crease do the same thing on the other
0:34
side and now fold this edge here to Land
0:38
again close to the center crease but not
0:40
all the way to it and do the same thing
0:43
on the other
0:47
side and we're going to fold in one more
0:49
time just like this making it really
0:53
narrow and you want to leave a gap once
0:55
again do the same thing on this
0:58
side
1:00
just like that and now you can fold this
1:03
in half and fold the Wings by taking
1:06
this edge here all the way to that
1:07
bottom Edge just like that and unfold
1:11

1:14
side just like that and this is a
1:17
finished paper airplane so if you want
Outro
