Intro
0:00
in this video I'm going to teach you how
0:01
to make this absolutely amazing paper
0:03
airplane that flies over 100 ft and it
0:06
is so easy to fold that I'm going to
0:08
teach you how to make it in literally 60
0:09
seconds or less so grab your sheet of
0:12
paper it can be 8 1/2 by 11 in or A4
0:15
whatever you have on hand and we're
0:16
going to begin in 3 2 one go Begin by
Tutorial
0:21
folding it in half like
0:24
this open the paper up and you can fold
0:27
triangles like this but leave a little
0:29
gap between The Edge and the center
0:31
crease do the same thing on the other
0:34
side and now fold this edge here to Land
0:38
again close to the center crease but not
0:40
all the way to it and do the same thing
0:43
on the other
0:47
side and we're going to fold in one more
0:49
time just like this making it really
0:53
narrow and you want to leave a gap once
0:55
again do the same thing on this
0:58
side
1:00
just like that and now you can fold this
1:03
in half and fold the Wings by taking
1:06
this edge here all the way to that
1:07
bottom Edge just like that and unfold
1:11
that do the same thing on this
1:14
side just like that and this is a
1:17
finished paper airplane so if you want
Outro
1:20
you can use a little tape to hold that
1:22
together but it'll fly well even if you
1:23
don't do that so let's see this thing in
